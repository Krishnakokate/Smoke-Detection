# Smoke Detection Using Machine learning

## Overview
This project implements a smoke detection model using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains information about various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and gas concentrations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available in the `smoke_detection_iot.csv` file located in the `csv` folder.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (mentioned in the code)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Krishnakokate/Smoke-Detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Smoke-Detection`

## Running the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`
2. Open the `Smoke_Detection.ipynb` notebook.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## Model Evaluation
The project evaluates the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting.

## Results
The project provides accuracy, F1 score, and AUC metrics for each algorithm on the test set.
